# Synthetic Memcached

Memcached fake, benchmarking server.

This implements the architecture of memcached, so a fairly
high-performance network service for request/response style workloads.
Multi-threaded with whole connections as the unit of distribution for
load-balancing. Connections are round-robbin'd to threads and once
assigned, are stuck.

No load-balancing or QoS after that.

Code is largely taken from memcached itself but cleaned up a lot.

## Building

The code is simple enough that we just use a single make file, no
autotools or other complications. We do call `pkg-config` to find
libraries and expect you to have `gsl` and `libevent` installed.

```
make
```

Should be it!

## Memcached protocl support

Implemented commands:
 * GET -- just respond with a fixed value to every single key.
 * SET -- parses command and returns ok but doesn't actually store
          data.

Other commands could be added easily but aren't needed for what I
want.

## Get involved!

We are happy to receive bug reports, fixes, documentation
enhancements, and other improvements.

Please report bugs via the
[github issue tracker](http://github.com/dterei/synthetic-memcached/issues).

is mostly taken from [memcached](http://memcached.org), with some
cleaning and structural changes into a cleaner code base.
